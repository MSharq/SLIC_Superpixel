<h1>SLIC Superpixel segmentation</h1>
The C++ & openCV based implementation of SLIC (Simple linear iterativ clustering) Achanta et al (Radhakrishna Achanta, Appu Shaji, Kevin Smith, Aurelien Lucchi, Pascal Fua, and Sabine S Ìˆusstrunk), the code is derived from the implementation, link https://github.com/pakokol/SLIC_Superpixel.
I changed and fixed some parts and uploaded it here. In addition , we get the final images in 2 different forms, one with the mean of the clusters SLIC_mean.jpg and one with original image divided SLIC_red.jpg. I hope it helps people looking for a stable solution.
